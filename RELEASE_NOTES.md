<!-- release: v2.12.1478-nir.5 -->

## PowerSync Nir fork
- Both logical EVs now display the physical Generic Charger entities configured in integration options. Physical switch/current/status/power settings (or selected Sigenergy EVAC transport) remain owned by the integration, not separate per-EV app records; conflicting app edits are rejected and stale vehicle overrides cannot drive shared commands.
- Logical EV A and B usable capacities can be edited or explicitly cleared in integration options. They use the same per-EV vehicle records as the app/dashboard; an omitted field preserves its existing capacity. The old charger-wide Generic capacity no longer applies to bound logical EVs.
- Charging-schedule preview and Price-Level projection use each logical EV's own capacity instead of treating a Generic-backed logical EV as an anonymous charger.
- The fork's maintainer inventory and repository instructions now identify this split as an intentional upstream divergence requiring hunk-by-hunk review.
- Local private regression gates and focused capacity/app/preview tests passed. This release does not install or restart Home Assistant and does not operate the charger; update through HACS in an idle, backed-up window.
